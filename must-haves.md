# Must-Haves

Below  you  will  find  an  overview  with  all  our  endpoints  and  a  categorization  by musts,  shoulds  and  coulds.  In  addition,  you  will  find  further  important  special features for individual endpoints. Please note that the categorization is of course only valid for your respective scope of services. If, for example, you only want to cover  the  order  processing  process  in  your  service,  then  only  the  musts  from Orders, Shipments and Returns apply. We will be happy to advise you and answer any further questions you mayhave about individual musts, shoulds and coulds.

**Musts:** Endpoints that are mandatory order to use the respective interface
**Shoulds:** Endpointsthat are recommended but not mandatory
